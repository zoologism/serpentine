# Serpentine
##### A snake game written in Ruby

## Gameplay

Use the W, S, A, D keys (or arrow keys, or hjkl) to change the snake's direction.

Each fruit (%) increases your score by 1.

Bonuses (Â£) have a 1/10 chance of spawning on collecting a fruit. Each bonus increases your score by 5.

Each time your number of fruits collected reaches a triangular number (3, 6, 10, 15...), the level/speed increases.

Crashing into the edge of the grid or any part of the snake ends the game.
